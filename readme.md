# LibreWolf macOS

OSX version of LibreWolf.

The browser can be built from source or it can be installed using a disk image, links to both methods are available below.
In case of feedback, suggestions or trouble fill an issue and let's solve it togheter. I would, in particular, appreciate feedback and contribution on the bulding process which so far has been tested on BigSur.

## Notes and thanks
The `./patches` are partially taken from the [Windows](https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/browser/windows/) repository, I mainly removed some Windows related stuff and added a new patch. The build script is also mostly based on the above mentioned Windows repository, a ton of thanks to the maintainer who basically made this possible. More in general thank you to all the LibreWolf users and contributors as this is entirely a community effort.
